# Assignment 1 - Pass the Pigs

This program uses series of arrays and loops, to operate a game in which 
the user inputs number of players and a random number assigned to "seed";
The program then auto generates a random number sequence to roll the "dice/pig".
The players play until they reach 100 points; they get points based on the 
position of the pig, and switch turns the moment they roll a "SIDE". 

The output: player names are shown, as well as the position they roll. Whoever
wins gets a congratulations message with the number of points they recieved.
